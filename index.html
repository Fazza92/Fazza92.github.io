							<h2>Who I am</h2>
						</header>
						<br>
						<p>My interest and passion for technology really started since I was a kid. I always remember helping my family with their cell phone and computer issues, and having a really fun time in the process. Going forward a couple years I was working as a customer service representative which did help me with my communication skills but didn't allow me to be creative.</p>
						
						<p>At work, I helped my co-workers out with computer issues that they were having at any moment I could, and eventually, a few members from IT advised me to look into a career with technology. While working I studied for CompTIA IT certifications and after months of hard work, I was offered a help desk position at my job. Sadly it never went through, but I didnâ€™t give up.</p>

						<p>Eventually, I was able to land a position as a Data Analyst where I was exposed to coding. It wasn't much but it grabbed my interest. I ended up taking a few free courses, and I knew that this was the field I want to be in. It gives me so many great opportunities and allows me to be much more creative. I think my favorite is that it will surround me with the technology I grew up loving.</p>

							<h2>Stuff I enjoy</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Coding can allow you to be more expressive when it comes to creativity which is one of the reasons I enjoy.  But along with coding there are other interests I have.</p>

							<h2>Projects I've worked on</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Stellae: Personally built an app that allows users with an interest in celestial events to create a meetup, allowing them to create a unique experience with others that have a common interest. The user is able to view celestial events on a calendar and add it to their own calendar. User is also able to view a starmap to take a look at a couple of constellations.
						</p>
						<p>Currently trying out Python, but please go ahead and check out my Github to see more of my projects, link is provided below.</p>
